## Current

### ICOM: Developing a scalable individual-based ecosystem model to understand human impacts in complex natural systems.  
**Funded by:** MOMENTUM CSIC  
**Role:** Researcher (postdoc)  
**Topic:** Digital twins are an incredible tool that we can use to increase our understanding of how ecosystems function, as well as a tool that can produce accurate short- and long-term forecasts. The Doñana area is an amazing oppertunerty for a digital twin. Not only are there no mediterranean digital twins, Doñana has a rich history of scientific monitoring, spanning over 6 decades. As part of this project I will be   .

### Connectivity of the Iberian Lynx and the effect of species interactions 
Building a resilient ecological network of conserved areas across Europe for nature and people.   
**Funded by:** NaturaConnect - HORIZON-IA (2021 call).  
**Role:** Researcher (postdoc).  
**Topic:** Connectivity analyses are an incredible usefull tool when shaping future policy aimed at protecting and improving nature and biodiversity in Europe. However, the typical analyses are not capable of capturing the dynamic relationships species might have with their habitat. In the case of the Iberian lynx, habitat use and therefore connectivity is mostly driven by the presence and abundance of the European Rabbit. The purpose of this project is to investigate how species interactions can effect connectivity. For this purpose we use two linked spatially explicit individual based models of the Iberian Lynx and European Rabbit.
