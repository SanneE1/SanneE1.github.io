As a population ecologist, I am interested in seeing how underlying processes influence population dynamics. My work includes simulation studies, meta-species analyses and more applied conservation analyses of single species. My previous work has mostly focussed on (herbaceous) plants but in my current positions I'm focusing on animal populations.   

During my Phd I've been focussed on investigating how climate influences population dynamics. In particular, I've tested long-standing assumptions about the _a priori_ assumptions of **when** climate is important to plant vital rates (e.g., survival or flower probability).

Currently I'm using spatially explicit demographic models to adress several several pressing conservation questions. First, I'm collaborating with several collegues at the EBD, NaturaConnect and LynxConnect to model the population dynamics of the Iberian Lynx. The purpose of the model is to increase our understanding of the current state of the Iberian Lynx subpopulations. The model is linked to a similar model for the European Rabbit, allowing us to investigate how the interaction between these two species influences our predictions.  
In addition, as part of


## About me
My interest in biology and ecology started very early. My interest has only grown since then, although now I actually know how some of it works. Although my interests have lead me to a job that consists mostly of working behind a laptop, I do still take every oppertunity to go out and hike through nature. 

Besides getting to work with amazing people, I also thoroughly enjoy the places my work has brought me; discovering new areas, cities, countries and cultures. 

Besides work, I have several other things that take up most of my free time. First and foremost is my dog. Yes, I am a full blown millenial dog mom. Luckily, my little crazy is a great companion who helps me decompress and forces me out for little walks throughout the day, and is a great excuse to go out on hikes on the weekends to explore Sevilla and Andelucia.  
Second, is [Roller Derby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_derby). Both Leipzig and Sevilla have amazing teams with teammates who help making the cities feel like home, and who do not mind helping me decompress from deadline-stress through hugs and bruises!
