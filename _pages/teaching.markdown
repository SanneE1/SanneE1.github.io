I have had the chance to supervise some amazing students as well as teach some interesting classes and workshops. I honestly love the work I do, and being able to share my work, and all the frustration and triump that comes with it (or any type of coding really) is something I really enjoy. I am looking forward to more oppertunerties to supervise and teach that will come my way in the future.  


If a prospective student actually finds me, please do not hesitate to contact me to discuss our options! All my contact information is on the left side of this page!
