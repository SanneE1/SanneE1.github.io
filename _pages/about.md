As a population ecologist, I am interested in seeing how underlying processes influence population dynamics. My work includes simulation studies, meta-species analyses and more applied conservation analyses of single species. My previous work has mostly focussed on plants (herbaceous plants) but in my current positions I'll also be focusing on animal populations.   

During my Phd I've been focussed on investigating how climate influences population dynamics. In particular, I've tested long-standing assumptions about the _a priori_ assumptions of **when** climate is important to plant vital rates (e.g., survival or flower probability).


Currently I'm using spatially explicit demographic models to examen how climate change, habitat and species interactions influence functional connectivity and population dynamics in the southern Iberian peninsula 


## About me
My interest in biology and ecology started very early. My interest has only grown since then, although now I actually know how some of it works. Although my interests have lead me to a job that consists mostly of working behind a laptop, I do still take every oppertunity to go out and hike through nature. 

Besides getting to work with amazing people, I also thoroughly enjoy the other perk of Academia; discovering new cities, countries and cultures. As I am writing this, I just moved to Sevilla a couple of months ago, and am definitely enjoying the winter here, compared to Leipzig (DE). I do realise that this "perk" often turns into the biggest dissadvantage for most people, so lets see how long it lasts!

Besides work, I have several other things that take up most of my free time. First and foremost is my dog. Yes, I am a full blown millenial dog mom. Luckily, my little crazy is a great companion who helps me decompress and forces me out for little walks throughout the day, and is a great excuse to go out on hikes on the weekends to explore Sevilla and Andelucia. Second, is [Roller Derby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_derby). Both Leipzig and Sevilla have amazing teams with teammates who help making the cities feel like home, and who do not mind helping me decompress from deadline-stress through hugs and bruises!
